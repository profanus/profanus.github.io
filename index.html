        <h3>Real life comes first</h3>
        <p>
          We love World of Warcraft, but we have families, friends and
          jobs too. We don't play every day, and we don't expect you to
          either.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking for a guild that understands and encourages
          your life outside the game, we are are here for you.

        <h3>Fun and progress</h3>
        <p>
          We believe fun and progress are not mutually exclusive. Our raid
          environment is relaxed and enjoyable, but we are serious about
          progression and fixing our mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of raids, we organize many guild events, such as old raid
          achievement runs, PvP groups, mythic dungeon groups and world quest
          groups.

        <h3><a name="info">Raiding with Profanus</a></h3>

        <p>
          Profanus is a raiding guild on Ragnaros EU. Our purpose is to have
          good progression, while only raiding twice a week. In order to
          facilitate this, we have some guidelines and rules that apply to our
          raiders.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a raiding guild, our primary goal is to kill as many bosses as
          possible per raid. We have outlined how we achieve this below. Every
          Profanus raider is expected to know and to follow these rules.
        </p>

        <h4>Raid times</h4>

        <p>
          We raid Wednesday and Monday from <code>20:00</code> server time until
          <code>23:00</code> server time.
        </p>

        <p>
          During this time, we expect people to be online and available. We
          have a break in the middle of the raid where raiders can take care of
          whatever business.
        </p>

        <h4>Time inside raids</h4>

        <p>
          Our most important rule is not to waste time in raids. When properly
          followed, it ensures we can make the most of our raids. Below are
          some examples of how this rule applies in a concrete way, but the
          main takeaway is to be mindful of our time and not to waste it.
        </p>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>

        <p>
          Raiders should have enough food, flasks, and potions on you to make
          it through the raid. They are expected to be at the raid entrance 15
          minutes before the raid. We expect them to have read up on the
          tactics of new bosses we will be progressing on and to know how to
          play their class and spec.
        </p>

        <h4>Fun and progress</h4>

        <p>
          Raids are fun, but they must also be serious. Jokes are only funny if
          they don't waste other people's time or effort. We like jokes, but
          during bosses we expect our raiders to pay attention to the fight,
          the raid leader and their role.
        </p>

        <img src="img/standout.jpg" alt="Illidan">

        <h4>Attendance</h4>

        <p>
          We aim at having a raid team with at least 80% attendance. Since we
          only raid twice a week, it should be possible for everyone to meet
          this schedule.
        </p>

        <p>
          If people cannot make a raid day, we expect them to the officers know
          well in advance and to decline the raid invite. If someone often
          cancels right before the raid or doesn't show, we will try to replace
          them to ensure our regular raiding schedule.
        </p>

        <h4>Loot</h4>

        <p>
          We have a loot council consisting of the officers and raid leader to
          distribute loot. They will attempt to distribute loot to increase the
          overall performance of the raid. This means raiders might not always
          get the loot they want when they want it.
        </p>

        <p>
          When asked, the officers will provide a reason for the way they
          distribute loot. The goal is to be fair and sensible. At the end of
          the day, everyone will be geared in due time and there have generally
          never been issues regarding loot distribution in the raids.

        <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

        <p>
        We are committed to maintaining a peaceful, comfortable and tolerant community
        with people we consider friends and 'family'. As a member you are expected to
        have read, understood and abide by the following. Potential members are
        required to read this before applying. As we are an adult (20+) guild, the /g
        will sometimes contain adult content. Even so, these rules still apply. Minor
        offences will receive a warning, major and repeat offences will be punished
        with removal from the guild.
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>
          You are expected to treat fellow members in a friendly and inclusive manner.
          You are expected to treat constructive criticism with grace and dignity and be
          respectful of differing opinions.
        </li>

        <li>
          You are required to respect the time and effort of your fellow guildies.
        </li>

        <li>
          We operate a zero-tolerance policy towards slander and discrimination related
          to gender identity, body-size, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality,
          religious beliefs and level of experience. This also includes cruelty,
          derogatory commentary, bullying and sexual harassment.
        </li>

        <li>
          While we are all intelligent people who enjoy a good debate, controversial
          topics such as politics and immigration should be kept to an absolute minimum
          and if possible out of the public chat / teamspeak channel.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you have access to a player's personal information, you may not publish it
          without the player's explicit permission. This includes photos and anything
          related to social networks.  You are not to beg players for boosts, gold, loot
          or items. We aim to help members to the best of our ability, but it is a
          privilege and should not be demanded.
        </li>

        <li>
          The items in the guild bank are not a source of your gold. You are welcome to
          deposit items to contribute, however the officer responsible for the guild bank
          will decide whether it is necessary to sell an item and deposit profits in the
          bank.
        </li>

        <li>
          Raid loot is viewed as a group commodity in Profanus and not a personal reward.
          Items that are distributed via loot council are given fairly to ensure that the
          raid team has the best chance of progressing further. You may inquire the
          reasons why an item went to a certain player, but you may not complain about
          not getting an item.
        </li>

        <li>
          During raids we do not allow calling members out in public on the mistakes they
          make. Noticing these mistakes is the responsibility of the raid leader and role
          leaders. If you want to point something out, do it in /w to the raid leader.
          You may also offer help to the player in question provided that it is done in a
          friendly manner.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you have an issue with any of the members, you are expected to attempt to
          resolve the issue with said member. If that is not productive, you may request
          assistance from an officer and the officer is obliged to assist you to the best
          of his/her ability.
        </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Should any revisions be added to this, members will be notified accordingly.
