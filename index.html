        <p>
          Outside of raids, we organize many guild events, such as old raid

        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking for a guild that understands and encourages
          your life outside the game, we are are here for you.

        <h3><a name="info">Raiding with Profanus</a></h3>

        <p>
          Profanus is a raiding guild on Ragnaros EU. Our purpose is to have
          good progression, while only raiding twice a week. To make this
          happen, we have some guidelines and rules that apply to our raiders.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a raiding guild, our primary goal is to kill as many bosses as
          possible per raid. We have outlined how we achieve this below. We
          expect every Profanus raider to know and to follow these rules.
        </p>

        <h4>Raid times</h4>

        <p>
          We raid Wednesday and Monday from <code>20:00</code> server time until
          <code>23:00</code> server time.
        </p>

        <p>
          During this time, we expect people to be online and available. We
          have a break in the middle of the raid where raiders can take care of
          whatever business.
        </p>

        <h4>Time inside raids</h4>

        <p>
          To make the most of our raids, we don't want to waste time in them.
          This means we expect raiders to be on time, to have prepared, and to
          be in the right mindset.
        </p>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>

        <p>
          Raiders should have enough food, flasks, and potions on you to make
          it through the raid. We expect them to be at the raid entrance 15
          minutes before the raid. We also expect them to have read up on the
          boss tactics and to know how to play their class and spec.
        </p>

        <h4>Fun and progress</h4>

        <p>
          Raids are fun, but they must also be serious. Jokes are only funny if
          they don't waste other people's time or effort. We like jokes, but
          during bosses we expect our raiders to pay attention to the fight,
          the raid leader and their role.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="early-lg">
        <img src="img/standout.jpg" alt="Illidan" title="We are totally prepared...">

        <h4>Attendance</h4>

        <p>
          We aim at having a raid team with at least 80% attendance. Since we
          only raid twice a week, it should be possible for everyone to meet
          this schedule.
        </p>

        <p>
          If people cannot make a raid day, we expect them to the officers know
          well in advance and to decline the raid invite. We understand that
          life gets in the way sometimes, but planning is a virtue. As long as
          raiders are predictable, we will try to work with them.
        </p>

        <h4>Loot</h4>

        <p>
          We have a loot council consisting of the officers and raid leader to
          distribute loot. They will attempt to distribute loot to increase the
          performance of the raid as a whole. This means raiders might not
          always get the loot they want when they want it.
        </p>

        <p>
          When asked, the officers will provide a reason for the way they
          distribute loot. The goal is to be fair and sensible. At the end of
          the day, everyone will get gear in due time. There have generally
          never been issues about loot distribution in the raids.

        </p>

        <p>
          We are an old school guild where members play together, talk to each
          other and enjoy each other's company. As a result, there's always
          someone to play with. Our members run Mythic+ dungeons, do world
          quests, level together or hang out on TeamSpeak while doing their own
          thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also organize social events every week. For example, we organize a
          weekly alt raid, weekly Mythic+ dungeon runs, occasional war games
          and even RP events. We love it when our members organize events, and
          usually promote and support them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, we've accumulated a group of 'friends of the guild'.
          These are alumni of the guild or people we've met while playing.
          They're usually high-end raiders that enjoy the atmosphere and enjoy
          playing with us. You'll see them around in our organized events.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside the game, we use <a href="https://slack.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slack</a>
          to keep contact. Slack is where we communicate raid logs and upcoming
          events. We also use it to talk about the game, life and anything in
          between.
        </p>

        <p>
          In short, we're a group of friends that's always looking for more
          people to join us.

        <h3><a name="coc">Code of Conduct</a></h3>

        <p>
          We maintain a peaceful, comfortable and tolerant community with
          friends and 'family'. All our members have read, understood and abide
          by the following. Potential members should read this before applying.
          As we are an adult (20+) guild, the /g will sometimes contain adult
          content. Even so, these rules still apply. Minor offences will
          receive a warning, major and repeat offences will result in removal
          from the guild.
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>
          We treat fellow members in a friendly and inclusive manner. We treat
          constructive criticism with grace and dignity. We're respectful of
          differing opinions.
        </li>

        <li>
          We respect the time and effort of your fellow guildies.
        </li>

        <li>
          We do not tolerate slander and discrimination. Whether related to
          gender identity, body-size, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality,
          religious beliefs or anything else. This also includes cruelty,
          derogatory commentary, bullying and sexual harassment.
        </li>

        <li>
          We are all intelligent people who enjoy a good debate. That said, we
          try not to bring up controversial topics such as politics and
          immigration. If possible, we keep them out of the public chat and
          TeamSpeak channel.
        </li>

        <li>
          If we have access to a player's personal information, we do not
          publish it without that player's explicit permission. This includes
          photos and anything related to social networks. We do not beg players
          for boosts, gold, loot or items. We try to help members to the best
          of our ability, we don't demand it from others.
        </li>

        <li>
          The guild bank belongs to the guild. We deposit items to contribute,
          but we don't sell items for gold. The officer in charge of the guild
          bank decides if and when to sell items and deposits profits in the
          bank.
        </li>

        <li>
          Raid loot belongs to the group and is not a personal reward. The loot
          council considers many factors to ensure loot helps the team. We can
          always ask for the reasons why an item went to a certain player, but
          don't complain about not getting an item.
        </li>

        <li>
          During raids we do not call members out in public on the mistakes
          they make. Noticing these mistakes is the responsibility of the raid
          leader and role leaders. If we want to point something out, we do it
          in /w to the raid leader. We also offer help to the player in
          question, always in a friendly way.
        </li>

        <li>
          If we have an issue with any of the members, we attempt to resolve
          the issue with said member. If that does not work, we request help
          from an officer. They will do the best they can to help resolve the
          problem.
