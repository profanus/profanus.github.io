### Raiding with Profanus

Profanus is a raiding guild on Ragnaros EU. Our purpose is to have good progression, while only raiding twice a week. To make this happen, we have some guidelines and rules that apply to our raiders.

As a raiding guild, our primary goal is to kill as many bosses as possible per raid. We have outlined how we achieve this below. We expect every Profanus raider to know and to follow these rules.

#### Raid times

We raid Wednesday and Monday from `20:00` server time until `23:00` server time.

During this time, we expect people to be online and available. We have a break in the middle of the raid where raiders can take care of whatever business.

#### Time inside raids

To make the most of our raids, we don't want to waste time in them. This means we expect raiders to be on time, to have prepared, and to be in the right mindset.

#### Preparation

Raiders should have enough food, flasks, and potions on you to make it through the raid. We expect them to be at the raid entrance 15 minutes before the raid. We also expect them to have read up on the boss tactics and to know how to play their class and spec.

#### Fun and progress

Raids are fun, but they must also be serious. Jokes are only funny if they don't waste other people's time or effort. We like jokes, but during bosses we expect our raiders to pay attention to the fight, the raid leader and their role.

#### Attendance

We aim at having a raid team with at least 80% attendance. Since we only raid twice a week, it should be possible for everyone to meet this schedule.

If people cannot make a raid day, we expect them to let the officers know well in advance and to decline the raid invite. We understand that life gets in the way sometimes, but planning is a virtue. As long as raiders are predictable, we will try to work with them.

#### Loot

We have a loot council consisting of the officers and raid leader to distribute loot. They will attempt to distribute loot to increase the performance of the raid as a whole. This means raiders might not always get the loot they want when they want it.

When asked, the officers will provide a reason for the way they distribute loot. The goal is to be fair and sensible. At the end of the day, everyone will get gear in due time. There have generally never been issues about loot distribution in the raids.
