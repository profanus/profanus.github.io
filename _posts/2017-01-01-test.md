### Progress & Fun
  
We steadily progress through heroic content, and we usually kill some
mythic bosses before the end of a tier.

Outside of raids, we organize many guild events, such as old raid
achievement runs, PvP groups, mythic dungeon groups and world quest
groups.

### Real Life Comes First

We love World of Warcraft, but we have families, friends and
jobs too. We don't play every day, and we don't expect you to
either.

If you are looking for a guild that understands and encourages
your life outside the game, we are are here for you.
