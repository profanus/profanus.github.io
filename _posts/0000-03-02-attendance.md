#### Attendance

We aim at having a raid team with at least 80% attendance. Since we only raid twice a week, it should be possible for everyone to meet this schedule.

If people cannot make a raid day, we expect them to let the officers know well in advance and to decline the raid invite. We understand that life gets in the way sometimes, but planning is a virtue. As long as raiders are predictable, we will try to work with them.

#### Loot

We have a loot council consisting of the officers and raid leader to distribute loot. They will attempt to distribute loot to increase the performance of the raid as a whole. This means raiders might not always get the loot they want when they want it.

When asked, the officers will provide a reason for the way they distribute loot. The goal is to be fair and sensible. At the end of the day, everyone will get gear in due time. There have generally never been issues about loot distribution in the raids.
