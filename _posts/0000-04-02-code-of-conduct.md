### Code of Conduct

We maintain a peaceful, comfortable and tolerant community with friends and 'family'. All our members have read, understood and abide by the following. Potential members should read this before applying. As we are an adult (20+) guild, the /g will sometimes contain adult content. Even so, these rules still apply. Minor offences will receive a warning, major and repeat offences will result in removal from the guild.

*   We treat fellow members in a friendly and inclusive manner. We treat constructive criticism with grace and dignity. We're respectful of differing opinions.
*   We respect the time and effort of your fellow guildies.
*   We do not tolerate slander and discrimination. Whether related to gender identity, body-size, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality, religious beliefs or anything else. This also includes cruelty, derogatory commentary, bullying and sexual harassment.
*   We are all intelligent people who enjoy a good debate. That said, we try not to bring up controversial topics such as politics and immigration. If possible, we keep them out of the public chat and Discord channels.
*   If we have access to a player's personal information, we do not publish it without that player's explicit permission. This includes photos and anything related to social networks. We do not beg players for boosts, gold, loot or items. We try to help members to the best of our ability, we don't demand it from others.
*   The guild bank belongs to the guild. We deposit items to contribute, but we don't sell items for gold. The officer in charge of the guild bank decides if and when to sell items and deposits profits in the bank.
*   Raid loot belongs to the group and is not a personal reward. The loot council considers many factors to ensure loot helps the team. We can always ask for the reasons why an item went to a certain player, but don't complain about not getting an item.
*   During raids we do not call members out in public on the mistakes they make. Noticing these mistakes is the responsibility of the raid leader and role leaders. If we want to point something out, we do it in /w to the raid leader. We also offer help to the player in question, always in a friendly way.
*   If we have an issue with any of the members, we attempt to resolve the issue with said member. If that does not work, we request help from an officer. They will do the best they can to help resolve the problem.
