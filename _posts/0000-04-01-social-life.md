### Social life within Profanus

![Profanus after killing Archimonde](img/raid.jpg "Profanus after killing Archimonde")

We are an old school guild where members play together, talk to each other and enjoy each other's company. As a result, there's always someone to play with. Our members run Mythic+ dungeons, do world quests, level together or hang out on Discord while doing their own thing.

We also organize social events every week. For example, we organize a weekly alt raid, weekly Mythic+ dungeon runs, occasional war games and even RP events. We love it when our members organize events, and usually promote and support them.

Over the years, we've accumulated a group of 'friends of the guild'. These are alumni of the guild or people we've met while playing. They're usually high-end raiders that enjoy the atmosphere and enjoy playing with us. You'll see them around in our organized events.

Outside the game, we use [Slack](https://slack.com) to keep contact. Slack is where we communicate raid logs and upcoming events. We also use it to talk about the game, life and anything in between.

In short, we're a group of friends that's always looking for more people to join us.
