    <h4>Take a look at our Code of Conduct</h4>

    <p>
      Profanus is proud of its community, and a big part of that is our <a href="/#code-of-conduct">Code
      of Conduct</a>.

    <h4>Get an invite to our Slack</h4>

    <p>
      We require all members to sign up and join our Slack team. We use Slack
      to communicate outside of the game. We post important information and
      announcements here.

    <p>
      You can talk to Oomii to get invited here.

    <h4>Get a permanent invite to our Discord</h4>

    <p>
      We use Discord as our voice-communication tool. There are usually a few
      people online at any given moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can talk to any of our officers to get invited here.

    <h4>Install addons for raids</h4>

    <p>
      We use some addons during raids that we require all our raiders to
      install. If you do not have these installed before a raid, we may not
      invite you or you might not get loot. Note that you just need to install
      these, you do not necessarily have to configure them or use them outside
      of raids.
